SDL2 did not work on my machine, tried both Cygwin and MinGW(64 and 32bit) in Clion and tried using it in Visual Studio.
Tried both Visual Studio and MinGW specific versions of SDL2.
Closest to working was Clion with 64bit MinGW where code compiled but when any of the functions from SDL were used
'Segmentation Fault' would be thrown.
--------------
Managed to integrate SFML 2.5.1 32bit into CLion, it seems to run SFML's functions correctly, will use that as a substitute for SDL2.
--------------
Created repository with CLion project, added README in 'src' folder to state specific version of SFML and MinGW to use when compiling code.
Also created this file for any notes on progress.
==================

====09/02/22====
Completed first draft of the Project Outline document.
-------------
Started working on basic SFML functions and overall design of the code.
-------------
Created a couple of loops and started analysing ray casting algorithm; started working on map loading segment but stopped as it's not
needed for now. Test 2d array will be used instead.
